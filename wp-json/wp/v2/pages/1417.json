But unfortunately, we have evolved into these bloodthirsty competitors, so much so that mere survival has become an uphill battle, let alone carving out a niche for yourself out there in the corporate world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Thousands of business start-ups are launched every day, yet only a few hundreds of them can see the light of the day. So, what exactly goes wrong in those start-up formations, and why is it tough for most start-ups or even an established company to let itself from drowning under these arduous circumstances?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Well, there could be numerous reasons as to why these businesses tend to fail. Still, one of the most compelling reasons could be an inability or, in some cases, a lack of knowledge of how to handle the financial aspect of the business, which then leads to holding oneself back from thriving their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, one of the many reasonable or rational solutions can be a thorough evaluation of the financial areas where the company must be lacking behind thus hiring a virtual Chief Financial Officer (VCFO) who will take care of all the financial analytics of your company and help it bring back on its journey to success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But before we get onto the technical details as to how a VCFO is going to turn the fate of your company for the better, let&#8217;s first understand who and what is a CFO and what is the difference between an in-house Chief Financial Officer is is and a virtual Chief Financial Officer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Is A Chief Financial Officer And Its Role In An Organization?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fundamentally, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is an expert or a professional responsible for its finances and enhancing its current position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They handle all the financial matters of the company, such as the following: &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Planning and implementing the most profitable revenue model in the long run<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Budgeting and expense control to manage the smooth running of the operations<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bookkeeping<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Improving the customer segmentation and insight<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Managing the cash flow of the company<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Formulating authentic reports and rectifying the errors according to the company&#8217;s needs etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hiring a Chief Financial Officer can be a game-changer for your organization; their analytical function can significantly impact the firm and quickly steer it toward success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So now that we are aware of what a Chief Financial Officer is and their role in an organization let&#8217;s get a basic understanding of what a virtual Chief Financial Officer is and how it is different from the conventional Chief Financial Officers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is common for most early-stage businesses not to have strong finances; so, hiring a Chief Financial Officer might seem a little unbelievable, if not too much, primarily because, in the initial stage, a business has to incur many expenses to establish itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, an experienced Chief Financial Officer is a pretty expensive investment as they typically charge somewhat between $ 300,676 and $502,063 according to the data provided by salary.com (21st July 2021); so, investing in an experienced Chief Financial Officer might drive the company to drown itself in financial distress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Introducing Virtual Chief Financial Officer (CFO) &amp; How Is It Different From In-House Chief Financial Officer (CFO)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is where the virtual Chief Financial Officer jumps in, acting like the miracle solution in the entrepreneurial world and saving the day. So, this brings the question of what a virtual Chief financial officer is?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Essentially, a virtual Chief Financial Officer can be defined as a typical CFO only with a lot more distinctive qualities, which makes it undoubtedly superior to the latter in more than one way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A virtual Chief Financial Officer is a new and improvised concept that enables start-up companies to seek the benefits of CFOs without worrying about their enormous salaries and thus to save thousands of dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Virtual Chief Financial Officer or a (VCFO) is a financial expert who is in charge of the financial facet of the business, such as operational optimizations within an organization; raising capital; systems analysis and design; fixing cash flow issues; implementing more efficient processes and systems; developing pricing strategies; and preparing for growth just like a traditional Chief Financial Officer but who is available as a part-time worker and who works remotely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They help strengthen the company&#8217;s finances by the company&#8217;s needs with much-reduced costs. A Virtual Chief Financial Officer brings the concept of &#8220;only pay for what you need&#8221; to the companies, making it the most rational choice under limited circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Key Benefits Of Investing In A Virtual Chief Financial Officer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The virtual Chief financial officer (CFO) role brings substantial welfare to small start-ups. Apart from the obvious cost-efficient advantages and enjoying all the financial insights and expertise which is usually limited to the giant multinational corporations, a virtual Chief financial officer (CFO) provides the following benefits to your organizations as well:-<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An Efficient Utilization Of Time As Well As Money<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The attribute or the characteristic that has captivated the corporate world, specifically the entrepreneurial part of the corporate world, towards the concept of virtual Chief Financial Officer is its flexibility and cost-efficient pricing, thus leading to saving thousands of dollars while enjoying the services provided by a full time chief financial officer (CFO) as you hire them only for the services you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a result, you only pay for what you require. Also, it has saved the company from going through both the cost and energy-draining process of recruiting a full-time chief financial officer (CFO).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hiring a virtual Chief Financial Officer brings productive time utilization for a business owner as a VCFO. It saves him from consuming unnecessary time on the recruiting process, budgeting, preparing financial reports, and a lot more. As a result, he can focus on working on the business instead of working in the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Managing The Cash Flow Of The Company<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cash flow is the spine of all kinds of business organizations, so essentially, it becomes essential to ensure a solid cash flow position of the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A virtual CFO can formulate cash flow statements that include stockholder equity, long-term assets, net income, and liabilities, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A regular and thorough evaluation of these cash flow statements results in strategies to maximize and strengthen the cash flow further, ensuring a healthy run of your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Forecasting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Financial forecasts can play a significant role in your ability to win investment and take the next step up the funding ladder, so this isn&#8217;t something to put off through lack of knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The virtual CFO supervises the financial functions through a series of timely formulated financial reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You gain complete visibility and clarity over your business financials through these extensive reports, therefore, giving you the power to make necessary decisions about your business&#8217; future and growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The virtual CFO explores opportunities to streamline your business with system improvements and modifications for the prosperity of the business in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Complex Financial Challenges<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A virtual Chief Financial Officer isn&#8217;t an average Chief Financial Officer. Since VCFOs work part-time, they usually work for more than one organization at a given time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They&#8217;ve worked with organizations of all sizes, industries, stages of growth, etc. So consequently, they have experience of not just one kind of industry but all the different kinds out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hence, they have more extensive knowledge and experience than the regular CFOs, and as a consequence of that they are the best out there in the market to deal with complex financial situations such as high business overhead; inability to raise capital; poor cash flow, and profitability; high client churn; and debt management and loan repayment; among other challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Strategic Insights For Increased Productivity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Business owners can concentrate on other salient matters and aspects of the business to ensure the success of an organization instead of exhausting their energy and time on areas that are not aligned with their skills and expertise, thus leading to increased performance of the organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other functions of virtual CFOs like financial planning, preparing tools and reports on financial matters, financial oversight to reduce the possibility of financial error, evaluation of accounting data of the company provides assistance to make all the profitable and favorable decisions for the prosperity and productivity of the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apsurge Of A Global Pandemic (Covid-19)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The global viral pandemic has had a significant impact on the workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to endangering public health, the economic and social turmoil endangers millions of people&#8217;s long-term livelihoods and well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We never thought that going outside and meeting people would become a privilege up until now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The last two years have substantially increased the emphasis and the requirement of the virtual world, so much so that even the giant multinational companies have shut down their workplaces and implemented the concept of work from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, the new work from the home era has naturally or consequently promoted the virtual aspect of all the jobs and automatically created a need to hire a virtual Chief Financial Officer and remove the possibility of further encouraging this daunting disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hence it is safe to say that bringing in a Virtual Chief Financial Officer by the small\/large business start-ups can expedite their way towards success than most companies out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Virtual CFO Services For Small Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To earn a profit or provide any charitable service, every business needs to earn a profit.

They have the expertise and skills in financial subject matters and financial strategic planning. They provide insights on budgeting and forecasting, prepare financial reports, give thorough analysis over the reports and current business finances, analyze the ongoing financial trends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And thus, identify the potential opportunities earlier than the rest of the market for the company to grab it, formulate strategies and policies to increase and improve the existing business finances and growth, manage the company&#8217;s cash flow, etc. They are responsible for all the financial decisions and rectifications. Therefore, reduce the burden for the firm owner to focus on the growth of the business for the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why do I Need a Virtual CFO?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In today&#8217;s competitive world, the survival of any organization has become challenging. We see thousands of start-ups getting winded up before they even see the light of the day, primarily because they couldn&#8217;t keep the businesses financially afloat. Money is the backbone of any business; however, any businessman does not understand using it efficiently to increase it further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, the business owner should be focusing on the areas where is their forte. The chief financial officer does take care of the business&#8217;s financial aspect; however, hiring one might financially drain you hence comes in virtual chief financial officer, one who plays the same role in significantly less money. Therefore, to save your business from financial distress, you should be investing in a virtual chief financial officer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Much Does a Virtual CFO Make?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As of 27th May 2021, a chief financial officer has an average salary is around $74,000\/ year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How is a Virtual CFO Different than an Accountant?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Accountants handle the reporting aspect of the finances, for example maintaining accounting books, filing taxes, etc. In comparison, a chief financial officer is responsible for analyzing the reports, strategizing accordingly, and executing a plan to optimize your current financial position. In addition, they identify the possible threats and opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So put, while proper accounting is just witnessing the present and reporting pasts and has nothing to do with making the company&#8217;s finances better or worse, a CFO will strategize, analyze, guide, and support your course accordingly to help you grow. In the financial realm, accountants are more about the past, balancing books, reporting results, and filing taxes. CFOs are responsible for brightening the company&#8217;s future by developing strategies, forecasts, and a roadmap to achieve future goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When do I Want a Virtual CFO?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A virtual chief financial officer can be hired right from day one since it does not charge a fortune for hiring them, unlike a chief financial officer. However, a business owner may or may not know how to handle the company&#8217;s finances and the correct way of putting the money in the business so that the business reaps double money in return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, one person cannot handle all aspects of the business, so the business owner should be handling the future ideas and growth of the business and hire an expert to handle the finances. Also, suppose the business is getting drained from its finances. In that situation, it is high time for the business to consider investing in a virtual chief financial officer to save the business from going bankrupt.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What are the Benefits of a Virtual CFO?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bringing a virtual chief financial officer to your team has many benefits.
