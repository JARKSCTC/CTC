Funds may be available in the market abundantly, but choosing the source of funds best suited to the requirements of each business plays an essential role in having a proper funding structure for an organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many business failures can be attributed to the wrong selection of funds, with debt servicing becoming difficult as the business progresses. In addition, the stipulations imposed by the fund providers may affect the smooth functioning of the organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The promoter will be an expert in his area like product, processes, etc. but may not have expertise in various intricacies in getting funding for the business at optimum cost.

These consultants could either be retired veterans who have had experience with venture capital firms and understand what causes them to tick, or they could be ex-establishers who have had successfully raised capital for their startups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Startup fundraising consultants have the required skillsets and expertise and a network of investors who can help you provide the capital to build your startup.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fundraising consultants could help you by directing your core idea, carrying out market and competitive analysis, substantiating your business plan, and providing analytical insights on your pitch deck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They have vast experience in fundraising (which comes in handy to first-time founders), can provide an unbiased perspective on different topics, can improvise existing plans, and have access to the right and rich network of investors, academics, and top talent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What are the 5 Sources of Finance?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Generally, there are many ways to get finance and funding for your business. However, if we talk about the primary five sources of finance, these are that tops the list<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Family and friends<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Crowdfunding<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Private equity providers<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Debt providers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What are the Best Ways to Find a Fundraising Consultant For an Early-stage Startup?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Start following Startups and Business Fundraising, compile and follow a list of best blogs on startups, and read on. Ask questions on the Q\/A section. Find a local startup group. Attend their meetings\/sessions. Join an accelerator and, in the meantime, build your startup. Develop a team, build a product-market fit, test, substantiate, get traction, go out and put your brand there for people to reach. Finally, indulge in some early sales or presales. You&#8217;re not going to be able to raise money until you have that done, so your consultant expense is premature.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How do Investors add Value to Startups?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The investors and venture capitalists (VCs) add value to startups in more than a few ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stakeholder Management: Investors are the backbone of the startup. They direct the company board and leadership to ensure smooth operations of the newly established firm. Further, their unrivaled experience and industrial knowledge of working and investing with startups steer the company in the right direction.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fund Raising: Investors are the guiding angels for the startup to raise successive funding rounds depending on stage, maturity, sector focus, etc. They help by networking and connecting the startups to pitch their business to other investors.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Recruiting the talent pool: investing in the high-skilled human capital is essential for the startup business, primarily when recruiting senior executives to assist with and drive business goals. With their extensively enriched network, venture capitalists can invest in the right human resources for the business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Advertising strategy: VCs guide you with the appropriate marketing strategy for your product\/service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coalition and acquisition opportunities: The venture capitalists should be aware of the latest business affairs and possible coalition and acquisition opportunities in the local entrepreneurial ecosystem to further strengthen the business through inorganic growth.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Organizational Rebuilding: with the gradual growth process from a startup to an acknowledged company, the investors help with the appropriate organizational restructuring and develop processes to increase capital efficiency, lower costs and scale efficiently.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Much do Fundraising Consultants Charge?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Consultant fees vary from person to person and organization to organization. Generally, consultants&#8217; fees include the service they have provided you along with covering their additional costings for things such as tax, insurance, training incurred by them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most good fundraising consultants charge either daily or by a fixed fee. If you&#8217;re still looking for a roundabout figure as to how much it would cost you to hire a consultant, you&#8217;re probably going to get an hourly rate from $100-$125 per day. These figures will vary significantly among different consultants.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Percentage do Fundraisers Take?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A 15 percent fundraising expense ratio is often cited as the &#8220;expected average.&#8221; So, let&#8217;s start with the most elementary of analyses. But it all depends on the expertise, skills, and experience years of the professionals and the type of industry you are involved in, and what kind of contract both you and the consultant agree on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is a Professional Fundraising Consultant?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Professional fundraising consultants are seasoned pros field marshals of the business world. They have just the right kind of skillset and expertise to manage the fundraising process for your business with several years of experience and vital networking by having links with people who can help your organizations get the funs you need. They outline the road map of the business with the founders and assess the required funds in terms of the quantum of funds and the reason for raising funds. They help you run your fundraiser right from the beginning to end.
