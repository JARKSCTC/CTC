It&#8217;s easy to set up a call centre. Everything you&#8217;ll need is a headset, a reliable internet connection, and a desktop or laptop computer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The thought of a c<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">all centre setup\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">might seem overwhelming for the uninitiated, but it is a necessary practice for your business growth. An impressive sixty-six per cent of respondents still use their phones for seeking customer support, making it the most common channel among all age groups. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why call centres are still so important in creating a positive client experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Over the years, after working with numerous high-profile clients, JARKS CTC observed that the customers expect call centre operators to be knowledgeable, helpful, and patient. Therefore, to foster client connections, your call centre must maintain a high level of customer care at all times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, establishing one&#8217;s call centre is a significant undertaking that demands meticulous planning and is not everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. Here is where expert\u00a0<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">call centre setup consultants<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0like JARKS CTC come to your rescue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Who Are We?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">JARKS CTC is a central B2B marketplace for cross-functional\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/JARKS CTC Private Limited\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">business consulting firms<\/span><\/strong><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, consulting, and execution needs.

Moreover, our experienced team members help you understand how the\u00a0<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">call centre setup process<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0works.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Can We Help?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The first step is to figure out why you need a new contact centre, with a particular focus on your goals and objectives. It&#8217;s also a good idea to consider the channels your clients use and where you need to be to meet their needs. Our qualified professionals help you assess your business scenario and help you get the most out of your opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you intend to relocate from your current location, establishing a new contact centre might also be an opportunity to rethink your business strategy. Revaluating any offshore or outsourcing contracts might be of help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Building your call centre is a significant undertaking that demands meticulous preparation, and it&#8217;s easy to get sidetracked along the way. You must also choose the size of a contact centre for your company to be successful. Then, you can base all your technology, recruitment, and office space depending on your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Guessing how many staff you will need may leave you with a 50-seat office or paying for a much larger space that you do not need \u2013 both of these scenarios could end up costing you a lot of money in the long run. Whereas, working with JARKS CTC will help you get the best professional service members and top-notch call centre facilities without breaking your company&#8217;s bank account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why Do Companies Need to Set Up a Call Center?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Firstly, one or more company objective is needed to design a call centre. So you must make sure you know those objectives before you start. For example, if your company&#8217;s goal is to boost <a href=\"https:\/\/JARKS CTC Private Limited\/legal-secretarial\/\"><strong>secretarial services<\/strong><\/a> and retention, implement call centre technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your specific business requirements will determine your primary objective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you manage a small business or a start-up, one of your primary goals might be to enhance lead generation, attract new consumers, or simplify payment and order processing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you&#8217;re in charge of a larger company, perhaps your primary goal should improve client happiness and overall support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inbound Client Inquiries Are Steadily Increasing?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do you need qualified customer service agents to manage all your calls? If your answer is yes to this question, we strongly advise you to invest in a call centre management team to ensure that the process runs smoothly and manages meticulously. Your current system will most likely be insufficient to handle the increased call volume, but a professional call centre solution will undoubtedly be of great help!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is Your Customer Service Department Becoming Overburdened?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Determine whether your company&#8217;s operations need the infrastructure of a call centre. For example, if you see a rise in call abandonment, low customer engagement, and a shattered customer experience, you&#8217;ll require a call centre setup.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Are You Having Trouble Generating Leads for Your Company?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inbound marketing has proven to be difficult for many new firms to get leads. Manually contacting prospects via phone calls and emails is ineffective and labour-intensive. Hiring an external call centre team is a good idea in such cases. Outbound call centre teams allow you to mass dial prospects in a tailored manner, <a href=\"https:\/\/JARKS CTC Private Limited\/advertising-and-pr-services\/\"><strong>advertising and pr services<\/strong><\/a>, enhancing lead creation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Getting Access to Professional Call Center Software<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Telemarketing or telesales representatives make calls for sales, appointments, and other marketing purposes to promote products and services. Therefore, your call centre should have an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system and call recording capability if call volume increases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Telemarketing necessitates the use of an outbound dialling system, such as a &#8220;Predictive Dialer&#8221; or &#8220;Auto Dialer,&#8221; which dials numbers from a list automatically. Depending on the amount of the data, you can store this list in an excel sheet or a CRM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Through sophisticated features like CRM integration, call recording, real-time monitoring, and real-time business analytics, predictive dialling-based call centre software boosts productive interactions, improves agent efficiency, and augments sales. But if you don&#8217;t have a call centre set up already, things might get expensive. An external team will already have the required technological infrastructure and place your company can leverage in that scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">JARKS CTC can help you connect with the leading offshore contact centre teams to enhance your business strategy, <a href=\"https:\/\/JARKS CTC Private Limited\/company-secretary-corporate-law-services\/\"><strong>corporate law services<\/strong><\/a> and boost your business growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Advantages of Remote Call Center Setups<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are several advantages to establishing a call centre with remote workers, including expanding your recruitment pool, minimizing business costs, and having more resource planning flexibility. Moreover, when you work with an expert call centre establishment, the following benefits add up to the list:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Enhanced data security<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reliable cloud provider<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Custom on-premise solution<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Multilingual team players<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Budget-Friendly Solutions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At JARKS CTC, we ensure that our clients access the best-in-class technology and workforce solutions without draining a lot of money.

Specifying it means choosing the type of call centre you want to build your business in since there is more than one type of call centre. It can be of various types: &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inbound call centre\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Outbound call centre<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Domestic call centre\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Automate call centre etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 2:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Develop the route\/plan about how the customers can get in touch with the agents<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The next step is crucial since it specifies how your customers are going to contact the agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Determine the need for an IVR:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0IVR stands for interactive voice response system. It would help if you decided on whether the customers will connect directly or use an IVR system. For example, will you be using just a welcome message, or will you offer a menu of choices? Further, if choosing a menu of choices, what will you add to it?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Including self-service: Decide if you want some customers routed to self-service through IVR to handle basic inquiries, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifying after-office hours or shifts: Using voicemails<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">post-office-hours and have alerts sent to email id\/s you specify.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 3:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Create Agent IDs<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Creating agent IDs will be the next step in setting up a call- centre. The agent IDs can be created with name\/nickname\/email ID or alphanumeric employee ID. If you have a CRM, agent IDs can be saved after them as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 4:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Specify Skill Groups<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Call centre software can connect calls to different Skill Groups. You can specify groups to consist of one or more agents based on the business size. For example, a skill group can be of queries, operational problems, etc., based on employee knowledge and permissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 5:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0specify your ACD Logic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">ACD is an Automated Call distribution that distributes the calls between agents efficiently, thus keeping call queues short. A SAAS or cloud-based contact centre means that these agents can be located anywhere. Keep in mind the following factors before specifying your ACD<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Decide Dynamic Real-Time Queue Reprioritization:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Define Sticky Agents:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Select the Distribution system:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 6:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Explain the data format for your dialers<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This step is specified particularly for outbound calling, for setting up your dialers. In this step, the data format is explained to the dialer. The dialer is then aware of finding the phone numbers to dial from within your contact lists\/database.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Step 7:<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Decide how to collect feedback<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">customer satisfaction is the most critical aspect of the business, and the next step measures customer engagement through a CSAT survey. Finally, you can close all calls with a quick CSAT survey.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the Most Important Thing in the Call Center?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Customer engagement is the most critical aspect of the call- centre. Adhering to the customer&#8217;s needs and grievances is the most critical job of any call centre.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What are the Types of Call Centers?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are different types of call centres.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Based on their functioning, the call centres can be of different types, which can be defined as follows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inbound call centres \u2013<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Inbound call centres are set up to receive calls from the common public, for example, customer service call centres. Company executives attend to customer queries and complaints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Outbound call centres \u2013<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Outbound call centre executives make calls to contact potential customers in a bid to do telemarketing. These are sometimes cold calls as well. It is done for sales purposes or providing information regarding earlier complaints etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Domestic call centres \u2013<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0These call centres operate only within the boundaries of a country, answering customers&#8217; queries within a particular country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">International call centres \u2013<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0The clients of these call centres are multinational companies. Therefore, the executives in such a call centre make and receive customer calls in different countries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Inbound Call and Outbound Call?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A call centre executive makes an outbound call to a client on behalf of a call centre or client. Outbound calls are generally for prospective customers and focus on sales, lead generation, fundraising, etc. These calls are also for existing customers to inform them about the latest updates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The customer makes an inbound call to the call centre. The call centre executives adhere to customer queries and complaints from these calls and other customer grievances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How do You Manage a Call Center?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To maintain an efficient working call centre, follow these measures: &#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Acquire an Efficient staff\/employees<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Call centres need a particular group of people. Apart from the technical skills, you want to go for a genuine passion for customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indulge in Comprehensive Training and Onboardin<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">g<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indulging in training and onboarding practices, you make the agents of your call centre fierce in what they do. They get prepared to handle whatsoever kind of situation and at the same time communicate the company&#8217;s standards and values. Cultivate a coaching culture between the employees by providing them with an environment wherein they can learn and grow through different opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Create a Communicative Environment<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To run a smooth and organized call centre, make sure your communication lines are always open so that agents and executives can come with their problems and queries to you at any time and an immediate action plan is taken for the grievances. Indulge in one-on-one meetings with your employees regularly to attend to possible improvements and suggestions<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apply Proper Scheduling<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Working in a call centre can be traumatic, hampering an agent&#8217;s productivity. In small scale call centres, this creates an even bigger problem since agents usually extend hours to accommodate their workload at these call centres, which automatically compromises the quality of the workload.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The solution to this problem is proper scheduling. Proper scheduling makes sure that your agents get enough time to recharge, so they don&#8217;t feel overworked.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Emphasize on Data to Make Sound Decisions<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Any wise and successful companies understand and emphasize the importance of data. In the context of customer service, data provides a better understanding of your customers and their behaviours to the call centre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Net promoter score, average handling time, first call resolution rate, etc., are just some of the essential tools that allow a call centre manager to attain insight into operations and make critically important decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apply Call Monitoring Tools<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Monitoring the call identifies any cracks in the way agents handle calls; depending on which the call centre can provide suggestions and improvement areas to its agents and executives to ensure a more efficient working from the employees and hence the organization for its customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Emphasize on Customer Feedbacks<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Typically, all organizations are and should be customer-centric, but the call centre is one such organization that is alive and breathing because of its customer-centric approach. A call- centre is about the customer and their needs from beginning to end. Successful call centres understand their customers. Customer feedback provides a way for you to hear and understand the voice of the customer. Any review or opinion from the customer you get should be taken into account seriously, and further necessary adjustments should be made to improve customer experiences and make them stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Invest in Technology<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As we all know how dominating role technology plays in the success of any organization, and the call centre is no exception; it is pivotal for you to be up to date with the latest technological advancements for the call centre to reach its full potential. Apply latest contact centre software, a feature like a call monitoring, IVR, etc. In your call centre to make it a smooth operation.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-0 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><\/ul><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call Center Setup Whether small, medium-sized, or large, any company requires a call centre set up for customer service or lead generation and\u00a0collection &amp; recovery agencies.
