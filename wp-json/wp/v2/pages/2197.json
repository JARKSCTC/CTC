What kind of people, process, and tool setup has been done to control any hacking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the contrary, CIO is technical but more business-focused and looks to use the technology to get desired intervention to achieve the business objective\/ vision. He understands the organization&#8217;s vision and associated business problems to achieve that business vision empathizes with business challenges. And partners with other business leaders to solve the business problem using technology intervention.
